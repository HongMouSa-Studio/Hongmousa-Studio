## 🅒 English

### Concept: Localization, Contemporary Aesthetic

**Design is the translation of life.  
Art is the window to the soul.**

Inspired by the land of Formosa, we seek colors that belong to us.

#### Every Stroke

Every stroke is a vision of the future.  
We are not just drawing; we are documenting the emotions of this era.

Through **HongMouSa Studio**, we hope to show the world Taiwan’s soft power.

##### Art in Everyday Life

- Not distant
- Not unreachable
- It exists around us

From the gentle countryside breeze to the city’s neon lights, everything inspires us.

We insist on using fresh aesthetics to express deep cultural meaning.
